# 🧠 JavaScript Mastery Notes
Welcome to my **JavaScript Notes Repository**.
This repo is my personal knowledge base built while deeply learning JavaScript from fundamentals to advanced concepts with a heavy focus on **interview preparation** and **real-world coding practice**.

---

## 📌 What's Inside
### 1. 🔥 Notes
- Detailed, no-fluff markdown notes on all major JavaScript concepts.
- Notes are taken and Inspired by **Namaste JavaScript (Season 1 and 2) Youtube Playlist** by Akshay Saini Sir.
- Cross-referenced with deep explanations, visual mental models, and real-world analogies.
- Topics covered include:
  - Execution Context, Call Stack, Hoisting
  - Closures, Functions, Callbacks
  - `this` keyword, Arrow functions
  - Promises, Async/Await, Promise APIs
  - Event Loop, Microtasks vs Macrotasks
  - And much more...

### 2. 💻 Practice
- Practical code snippets written by hand to reinforce concepts.
- Covers tricky JS behaviors often asked in interviews.
- Expect things like:
  - Recreating `Promise.all`, `bind`, and `throttle`
  - Async patterns, closures in loops, hoisting edge cases
  - Real interview scenarios and logical challenges
